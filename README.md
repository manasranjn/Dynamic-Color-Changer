# Dynamic Color Changer

A simple JavaScript script that changes the background color of the body element when the "Change Background Color" button is clicked. It also changes the font size of the title element when the "Change Font Size" button is clicked. Finally, it resets the background color and font size to their original values when the "Reset" button is clicked.
